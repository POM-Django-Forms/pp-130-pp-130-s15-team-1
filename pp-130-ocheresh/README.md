Create an admin panel for your projects.

In the admin panel:

* create a user with administrator rights
* create an additional user
* register all models listed in the models.py file
* configure the display of lists by adding additional model fields
* add list filters to make it easier to find information by book id, book title, book author
* create a layout with a detailed presentation for books and authors
* form a visual distribution of information about books so that there is a separate section with data that do not
  change (title, author, year of publication) and that change (date of issue of the book)

As a result of this sprint (except for the code in the repository) you should get a short video (2-10 minutes) showing
the functionality of the program.
